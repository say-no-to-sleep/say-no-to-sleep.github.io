            <h2>Computer Engineering Tutor</h2>
            <p class="date-location">Sep 2023 – June 2024 (Oakville, ON)</p>
            <p class="context">Informal Tutoring for Grades 10-12 Computer Engineering Classes</p>

            <p>Driven by my passion for engineering and a desire to help others, I dedicated my spare periods during my Grade 12 year to informally tutor students in Grade 10, 11, and 12 Computer Engineering classes. This role allowed me to work closely with the Computer Engineering teacher, with whom I had a great rapport, and provide support across a range of circuit building and programming topics.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Student Learning & Projects:</h4>
            <p>My approach to tutoring was to guide students towards solutions rather than providing direct answers, fostering their problem-solving skills.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grade 10 (Arduino & Circuits):</strong> I assisted students with foundational Arduino projects, such as LED marquees, and helped troubleshoot common circuit errors (like reversed LEDs or short circuits – one instance memorably involved a wire melting from a battery short!). I also helped students brainstorm and refine ideas for their self-proposed projects, guiding them based on their skill level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade 12 (Raspberry Pi & Advanced Projects):</strong> In the advanced Grade 12 classes (including a robotics-focused section), many projects involved Raspberry Pi. I found that some students were initially intimidated by the Linux environment (Raspberry Pi OS) and using the terminal. Leveraging my existing familiarity with Linux, I was able to help them navigate these initial hurdles. For my own project, I implemented an IR remote control system, and recognizing its potential difficulty for others, I proactively created a detailed tutorial with all necessary files and terminal commands to simplify the process for my peers. I also developed a tutorial on I2C communication for interfacing with components like OLED displays.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Knowledge Sharing & Resource Creation:</h4>
            <p>Beyond direct tutoring, I aimed to create resources that could benefit a wider group of students:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Introductions:</strong> I took the initiative to introduce the entire class to useful hardware components like the L293D motor driver chip, explaining its functionality and how to integrate it into their projects. I also reviewed Arduino pin layouts to solidify understanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>PLC Programming Guide:</strong> For a project involving Siemens PLC ladder programming (which many found unintuitive), I developed a tutorial explaining the logic and structure of ladder programs to help classmates understand how to complete their marquee assignments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Tutorials:</strong> As mentioned, I created guides for IR remote implementation and I2C communication on the Raspberry Pi, making these advanced topics more accessible.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The Computer Engineering teacher recognized the value of these resources and requested copies, expressing intent to potentially incorporate them into future curriculum materials.</p>

            <h4>Impact and Personal Growth:</h4>
            <p>This tutoring experience was incredibly rewarding and solidified my interest in teaching and explaining technical concepts. I found great satisfaction in seeing students grasp difficult topics and succeed in their projects. Key skills I developed and reinforced include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Communication:</strong> Effectively explaining complex hardware and software concepts to peers with varying levels of understanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Quickly diagnosing issues in students' circuits and code, and guiding them to solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Empathy and Patience:</strong> Understanding student frustrations and adapting my teaching approach accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reinforced Technical Knowledge:</strong> The act of teaching deepened my own understanding of the underlying principles.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This role also provided me with valuable volunteer hours and strengthened my connection with the school's engineering community.</p>
