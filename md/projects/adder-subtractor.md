Transistor-Level Gate Logic:

The report mentions referencing "Global Science Network" for transistor-level implementations. Can you briefly describe the type of logic used for the gates? For example, were they simple RTL (Resistor-Transistor Logic) where transistors act as switches? (A brief sentence like "We implemented basic RTL AND, OR, and XOR gates using NPN transistors as switches" would suffice).

> idk what is a RTL to be honest. I just saw gates as transistors on his website, monkey see monkey copy

Logisim vs. Tinkercad Role:

It seems Logisim was used for the initial gate-level design and testing of the adder/subtractor logic (as shown in the report's diagrams). Then, Tinkercad was used to translate that gate logic into a transistor-level schematic and also to simulate the transistor-level version. Is this understanding correct?

Yep!!! 

> Fritzing:

Your resume mentioned Fritzing. Was it used for this project at any stage, perhaps for an initial breadboard layout plan before committing to the more detailed Tinkercad version? (If not, we can omit it).

> Tinkercad was slow on the web. Fritzing is fast! I didnt write in report but I did try using fritzing a bit because its faster

Most Satisfying Moment / Key Learning (Personal Reflection):

Even with the breadboard reliability issues, what was the most satisfying part of this project for you personally? (e.g., seeing the first full adder work, successfully debugging a complex wiring error, understanding the logic from gate to transistor).

What's the one key thing you learned about the practical side of building complex digital circuits from discrete components?

> Love how identical static pure logical components can add together to perform calculations

Visuals for the Website:

The photo of the fully assembled breadboard circuit from your report cover is fantastic!

The Logisim diagrams showing the full adder and the chained adders/subtractor logic are also very illustrative.

The Tinkercad schematics are very detailed.

For the website's detailed project page, which 2-3 visuals do you think would be most impactful? I'd suggest:

The photo of the physical breadboard build.

A clear Logisim diagram showing the high-level structure (e.g., the completed 4-bit adder/subtractor from page 7 of your report).

Optionally, a small snippet of the Tinkercad schematic showing how a basic gate (like an XOR) was built from transistors, or one of Andrew's "more readable" wiring diagrams if you have it.

Your report is very comprehensive and honest about the challenges, which is great. We can craft a very strong narrative from this. Once you clarify these few points, I can draft the content for projects/project-adder-subtractor.html.
