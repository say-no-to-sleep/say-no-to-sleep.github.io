Target Audience & Scope:

What specific subjects or topics within "circuit building and programming" were you tutoring for grades 10-12? (e.g., specific programming languages, microcontroller basics, digital logic, specific project types).

> So for grade 10s, they were doing arduino with circuits. Some of the projects are fixed for example the first LED marquee project (which I helped some people). For example there was someone who was putting leds reversed, there was someone else who put a wire between two terminals of a battery and burnt the wire (melted the rubber off of it) which was interesting. For some of the later projects, some of them the students have to submit project proposals (and the teacher has to classify them as easy intermediate or hard which each has a ceiling on how many marks they can get) and get approved and do their own projects. I think I helped a little bit with the project brainstorm. For the rest of the project there was some students (I know most of them because they're also in robotics club) who are REALLY good at them and need no help, but some other people requires some kind of help still. I try to understand what they're trying to do with the project before helping, and usually I try to not directly give them the answer and try to point them in the right direction.
> For the grade 12s (they are in my class), I had 2 phases. For the first part of grade 12 I took computer engineering advanced and computer engineering advanced (robotics) for the second half.
> For the first half, we're basically learning Raspberry Pi and applying them (starting with again LED marquee). There was... some people who were less proficient in Linux than I was (I already started using linux) so the Raspi OS interface scared them and don't know how to use the terminal. Later there was a project (that we can choose ourselves) and I chose to implement a IR remote. I soon found out that it was not easy to implement (for other students) so I wrote a tutorial with all the necessary files and terminal commands that I tested work 100%. But there was still a student who was like "nah im too lazy to implement this just do it for me" so I just did it for him... (he ended up going to UofT commerce so he wasn't really a computer guy). Later I also made a tutorial on I2C, since there was components like the display which required I2C. 
> For the second half it's basically the same story except none of the projects were fixed and we just do whatever we wanted

Was this tutoring part of a formal school program, or a more informal setup?

> Informal!! So basically I have a spare period (I finish all math in grade 11) in both half of grade 12, so I could just do whatever I want. So I was like, I like engineering so I want to try teaching people and I ended up enjoying it. 
> I also have a great relation with the computer engineering teacher, he's just the sweetest guy ever and really kind. 
> Also I got a lot of volunteer hours from this

Improving Proficiency & Project Outcomes:

You mentioned an "average 20% improvement in project outcomes."

How was this improvement measured or observed? (e.g., fewer errors in projects, better grades, more complex projects completed, positive feedback from students/teacher).

> Bullshitted

Can you give an example of a common challenge students faced where your "targeted tutoring and mentorship" made a difference? What was your approach?

> "Help I can't get this circuit working"
> "Bro you put the LED in reversed"

> The actual details are unfortunately a bit blurry, I wish I recorded every detail when I helped people like 
> "Thanks for helping me!" me: "hold on I need to take notes"

Developing and Delivering Interactive Lessons:

You "developed and delivered interactive lessons on hardware concepts in collaboration with the teacher."

> Yes so I introduced the who class to a chip called L293D which can control motors, basically telling them how to use it, etc. 

What kind of "hardware concepts" did these lessons cover?

> Like the L293D, I also taught them the pin layout of arduino as well. 

What made the lessons "interactive"? (e.g., hands-on activities, demonstrations, Q&A, use of simulation tools).

> Project mostly.

What was your specific role in developing these lessons versus the teacher's role?

The "30% boost in student engagement and participation" is a great metric. How was this observed or measured? (e.g., more questions asked, more students participating in activities, teacher feedback).

> Bullshitted

Authoring Tutorials and Guides:

You "authored 2 comprehensive tutorials on PLCs and 3 instructional guides on Raspberry Pi."

What specific topics did the PLC tutorials cover? What level were they aimed at (beginner, intermediate)?

> Yes so that PLC one was for the first half of grade 12. (computer engineering ). We have to do a little marquee program with the siemens plc ladder programming. I figured it out, but a lot of other students were confused on how to do it so I made a small tutorial on how the code works (because ladder programming sucks and it's not really intuitive)

What kind of projects or tasks did the Raspberry Pi guides help students with?

> All sort of projects, see above

How do you know they were "integrated into the curriculum and utilized by over 50 students"? Was this through teacher adoption, or did students access them independently?

> Some of them are intrigued some are not. 50 students I think I bullshitted that.
> By integrated into the curriculum I meant that the teacher asked me to send over all my tutorials so he "might" use them. IDK how the teacher used it afterwards because I graduated :)

Overall Impact:

What did you find most rewarding about this tutoring experience?

> I LOVE TEACHING seriously I consider the possibility of me teaching in the distant future.
> But maybe it was because these students knows what they're doing (the majority anyways)

What key skills (technical or soft skills) do you feel you developed or significantly improved through this role?

> Explaining technical stuff and teaching mostly. I've actually unofficially taught other student many things when they're confused. Also I think it enforced my technical skills.
