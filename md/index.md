Jinyuan (Eugene) Zhao - About

Jinyuan (Eugene) Zhao
University of Waterloo


I am a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, currently in my 1B semester. I have experience in web scraping, QA testing and embedded systems. 

My primary academic interests lie in computer architecture, machine learning and theoretical physics. I am particularly curious about how they can be integrated, for example, specialized hardware to accelerate machine learning algorithms, or computer models for physics theories. I am actively seeking opportunities to investigate the intersection of these fields through research and practical experience.


Skills

Languages

I am proficient in Python, Java and C++. More recently, I am learning C and Dart for mobile app development

Web/Automation

I have experience in Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Postman API testing for web scraping and automation tasks.

Libraries/Tools

I have used OpenCV and Scikit-learn extensively as part of my Resistor Sorter project, where each resistance value is determined and sorted.

I also have experience in Git for source control, Conda for Python environment management.

PhotonVision was used in Robotics Club, where we used it to determine the location of game pieces and perform automatic pickup. 

The tkinter library is also used multiple times throughout all my projects to provide a manipulable and beautiful looking frontend.

Hardware/Other

I have had extensive experience in Raspberry Pi as well as Orange Pi, and recently systems such as STM32 or ESP32.

I use Linux as my daily driver to better familiarize myself with its workings and system architecture.

SolidWorks, Fritzing, KiCad and TinkerCAD were also used in my previous projects for CAD modeling, circuit design and prototyping. 

Machine Learning Frameworks

Experiences with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for training and evaluating machine learning models.

I have implemented CNNs and ResNet architecture for computer vision tasks, including feature extraction.
