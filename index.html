            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, currently in my 1B semester. I have experience in web scraping, QA testing and embedded systems.</p>
            <p>My primary academic interests lie in computer architecture, machine learning and theoretical physics. I am particularly curious about how they can be integrated, for example, specialized hardware to accelerate machine learning algorithms, or computer models for physics theories. I am actively seeking opportunities to investigate the intersection of these fields through research and practical experience.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>I am proficient in Python, Java and C++. More recently, I am learning C and Dart for mobile app development.</p>

            <h3>Web/Automation</h3>
            <p>I have experience in Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Postman API testing for web scraping and automation tasks.</p>

            <h3>Libraries/Tools</h3>
            <p>I have used OpenCV and Scikit-learn extensively as part of my Resistor Sorter project, where each resistance value is determined and sorted.</p>
            <p>I also have experience in Git for source control, Conda for Python environment management.</p>
            <p>PhotonVision was used in Robotics Club, where we used it to determine the location of game pieces and perform automatic pickup.</p>
            <p>The tkinter library is also used multiple times throughout all my projects to provide a manipulable and beautiful looking frontend.</p>

            <h3>Hardware/Other</h3>
            <p>I have had extensive experience in Raspberry Pi as well as Orange Pi, and recently systems such as STM32 or ESP32.</p>
            <p>I use Linux as my daily driver to better familiarize myself with its workings and system architecture.</p>
            <p>SolidWorks, Fritzing, KiCad and TinkerCAD were also used in my previous projects for CAD modeling, circuit design and prototyping.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Experiences with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for training and evaluating machine learning models.</p>
            <p>I have implemented CNNs and ResNet architecture for computer vision tasks, including feature extraction.</p>
